# hello!! This is a short tutorial on how to do what we did in lab! :D :3
I skipped downloading VS Code into my laptop because I used the CSE computers. In order to open VS code on the computers follow these simple steps:
1. Log into the computer. I used Linux so I used my course specific username and password to log in. 
2. Then click the top left where it says **Applications**.
3. Then find the **Progamming** section then find **VS Code** in the sub section of **Programming**.
4. You have successfully opened VS Code!

# Now we will log into VS code remotely!
1. First type in the code that is in the LAB instructions. 
2. FOr me it didn't work, so we figured it out! Yippeeee! We wrote -202 after ieng6 and it allowed me to input my password.
3. After inserting my password the following code was the output:

# Now that we're logged in we can start having fun a mess with code!
1. Try inputting certain commands like:
>Blockquote cd ~
>Blockquote cd
>Blockquote ls -lat
>Blockquote ls -a
>Blockquote ls <directory>
2. After typing these you should expect a lot of different outputs.
Try messing around with the input too!
